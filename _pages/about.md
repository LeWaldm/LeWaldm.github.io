I am a Master student in [Mathematics in Data Science](https://www.tum.de/en/studies/degree-programs/detail/mathematics-in-data-science-master-of-science-msc) at [TUM](https://www.tum.de). I am interested in developing sufficiently reliable algorithms with focus on potential applicability in human-centered settings like medicine or biology.

Previously, I have worked at [Helmholtz AI](https://www.helmholtz.ai/) on treatment effect estimation from observational health records, at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Cognitive Systems IKS](https://www.iks.fraunhofer.de/) on robustness and out-of-distribution detection, and at the [cnnp-lab](https://sites.google.com/view/cnnp-lab/) on explainable and predictive biomarkers from iEEG-data. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics with a minor in computer science from TUM and studied at [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/) on exchange with a focus on applied mathematics.
