I am a Master student in Mathematics in Data Science at TUM. I am interested in developing reasonably reliable algorithms with focus on potential applicability in human-centered impactful settings like medicine or biology.

Previously, I have worked at Helmholtz AI in treatment effect estimation with balanced representations and at the Fraunhofer Institute in robustness and out-of-distribution detection. I hold a Bachelor in Mathematics with a minor in computer science from TUM and studied at Lund University on exchange with a focus on applied mathematics.
